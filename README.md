# CaRPMapProject

CaRPMapProject was a mapping effort aimed at making CaRP more accesible as when this was created there was no way to know where things where as a new player.
In February 2022 CaRP added a GPS function, which made this map obsolete, so this project got abandoned.
But in early 2023 CaRP introduced a new trading system, which brang back the need for maps, so then [Toino](https://toino.net/) started a new mapping effort based on this one, which is still on going and regularly updated.
This is now archived as of 2023-01-05.
